My name is Jordan Gidman. (Jordan is just fine.) I am an avid programmer and gamer. I am 20 years old and have been programming since I was 12 years old. I’ve spent those 8 years developing games, mods for games, and working on various software projects. I have experience using Node.JS and Python in a production environment.
I’m fairly quiet however, I’m not afraid to offer my solutions, comments, and perspective when needed. 
I look forward to working with OLE.
